The Colorado River Basin Hydrology Explorer is an interactive website made using 
the [Shiny App](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package in R. 
The application includes various abilities to explore and visualize Colorado River Basin hydrology 
under future projected conditions. Forthcoming companion publications will detail 
the methods behind the data, and include a case study using the App.

More info will soon be made available here.
