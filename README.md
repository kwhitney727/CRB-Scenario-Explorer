The Variable Infiltration Capacity model Explorer (VIC-Explorer) is an interactive website made using 
the [Shiny App](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) package in R. 
The application includes various abilities to explore and visualize VIC (Variable Infiltration Capacity) model results. 
Forthcoming companion publications will detail the methods behind the data, and include a case study in the Colorado River Basin using the App.

More info will soon be made available here.
